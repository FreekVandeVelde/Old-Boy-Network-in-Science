## The data do not support the existence of an 'Old Boy network' in science

*By Freek Van de Velde and Benedikt Heller*

This repository contains the supplementary materials of our re-analysis of a paper by Jorg Massen and colleagues (see below). It consists of 
- an HTML file that contains our analysis and the R code that was used to run it;
- an R Markdown file that was used to build the PDF file.

Our repository does not include the original dataset, which belongs to Jorg Massen and colleagues. Please contact them if you want to replicate our analysis.

## Sharing of science is most likely among male scientists by Jorg Massen and colleagues

Our re-analysis refers to the article [Sharing of science is most likely among male scientists](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13491-0) by Jorg J. M. Massen, Lisa Bauer, Benjamin Spurny, Thomas Bugnyar, and Mariska E. Kret.

In the study, Massen et al. interpret their data as indicative of an 'Old Boy network' in academia. In our re-analysis, we come to different conclusions but we would like to thank Jorg Massen and colleagues for sharing their data and thus making this re-analysis possible.
