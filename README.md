## The data do not support the existence of an Old Boy network in science

*By Freek Van de Velde and Benedikt Heller*

This repository contains the supplementary materials of our re-analysis of [Sharing of science is most likely among male scientists](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13491-0) by Jorg J. M. Massen, Lisa Bauer, Benjamin Spurny, Thomas Bugnyar, and Mariska E. Kret.

Although we draw different conclusions from Massen et al.'s dataset, we want to express our gratitude to Jorg Massen and colleagues for sharing their data for re-analysis.
